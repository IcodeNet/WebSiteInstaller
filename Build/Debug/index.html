in this folder we will have all the artefacts that are produced after we publish the web site.
Lets say that we just have index.html for now...

under the right configuration and 
because each environment can have a different config file,
 and we want to offer to the user the ability to select the right one we have in the publish artefacts,
 a folder with all the configs.
 
 Obvioulsy a real publish will include a web.config that we have to delete
 on a pre build script so that the user chooses the one from the configs folder.
